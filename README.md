# Self-Organizing-routing-algorithm-for-Unmanned-Aerial-Vehicles

• Designed a routing algorithm for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles based on haversine formula and similar concepts from Geographic Information Systems
• Mapped the geographic area to a graph data structure and the algorithm suggested appropriate routes to destination
• Designed a routing algorithm based on haversine formula and similar concepts from Geographic Information Systems having an average response time of 0.098 seconds for 1 mile of distance between source and destination
• Simulated the routing of drones for disaster recovery situations with Google Maps API V3 helping in tracing the flight path

Project Source Directory Structure:
